Then, each _Gripper_ instance is initialized with the robby and all balls in room _A_ and the goal is to move all balls to room _B_.

    "[Action Model Learning benchmarks](https://github.com/jsego/bfgp-pp/tree/main/domains/aiplan4eu/action_models). These benchmarks are similar to STRIPS with negative preconditions, but every instance represents a deterministic transition (pre-state is the initial state, and post-state is the goal), hence they need to include information about the executed action as a predicate, e.g. for picking a ball in room _A_ in the _Gripper_ domain, the following fact `(action_pick ball1 rooma right)` must appear in the initial state. The following shows an example for learning the picking action of _Gripper_ given 20 picking deterministic transitions."
